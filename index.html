        <h1>Welcome to the World of CodeChat</h1>
        <p>Within the next few minutes, you will be learning about codechat. a unqiue system designed for literate programing. What is literate programing though?</p>
        
        <h2>Literate Programming</h2>
        <p> Literate programing is about explaining the code not to a computer but to a person. Alot of time in the industry code is passed around. Without the comments explaining how the code works and why that perticular code was chosen, the next person working on the code may have to start over. This is a waste of time and money to the industry.  </p>

<!--this is how you create comments in html. The <html> I used the <htmle lang="eng" tag to state that this document is in english. The body is where we can add links, pictures, videos, and ext. The style page (as long as it is called out in the <head>) will apply to all sheets. this will allow for a uniform looked through the project.-->
