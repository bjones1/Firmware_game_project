**Development**

We came up with the concept to build this website because we recognized a need for a single textbook that had all of the links and material for this course. Because this is the first semester that this course has been offered, students may find it challenging to grasp some aspects of the class at first, such as the format and spacing in the code chat software. This guide was intended to assist you in navigating the classÂ materials and serves as a general overview of everything you will learn.

*Present*
----------------------
**Format of this E-book**

*  The walkthrough html page that explains the information that will be covered in the codechat course "walkthrough.c"
*   The jeopardy game interactive game that will test your knowledge of what you read in the walkthrough

*Future* 
------------------
**For the next group:**

*Homepage.html*
    * Work on centering text on page
    * Add button functionality for additional codechat links once completed by other groups
*Game1_page.html*
    * Make the Jeopardy game chart more centered than it currently is
    * Come up with questions good for beginners to codechat, we suggest asking both the class and Dr. Jones for suggestions
    * Code a way to run the html game questions page to check if the answers are correct
    * Add additional games that cover more topics in class
*Walkthrough*
    * Put more codechat information that will help anyone that takes this course
    * Ideas: troubleshooting, etc...
    * Add more information relating to SmartGit, Github, adding themes to sphinx, etc...

**End Goal**

We hope to make the features of the Jeopardy game multiplayer and able to keep track of the players score. Also with the future development of this course we hope more guidebooks can be added for Github and trouble shooting.
